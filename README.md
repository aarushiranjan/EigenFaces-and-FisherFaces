# EigenFaces-and-FisherFaces
Explored parameters, eigenspaces, and Fisher's linear discriminant for supervised and unsupervised learning. Successfully handled face recognition databases, implemented decision boundaries, and separating hyperplanes. Ensured no code copy-pasting to maintain academic integrity.
